        Ukraine, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces battled Russian 
        invaders on three sides on Thursday after Moscow unleashed the 
        biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, prompting tens of 
        thousands of people to flee their homes.

        After Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war in a 
        pre-dawn televised address, explosions and gunfire were heard 
        through the day in Ukraine's capital and elsewhere in the country, 
        with at least 70 people reported killed.
